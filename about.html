      <h1>my counseling philosophy</h1>
      <h1></h1>
      <p> For the past 20 years it has been my privilege to work with a diverse group of individuals including children, adolescents, and adults with the goal of helping them resolve harmful beliefs and behaviors and replace them with a healthier, more meaningful approach to their lives. Everyone has a unique story and different mental health needs. I have years of experience and specialized training, a comprehensive understanding of family systems and relationship dynamics to put to work for you but I believe that engagement is the art of clinical practice. I strive to create a safe and warm clinical environment, one that will enable you settle in quickly and as we work together to achieve your treatment goals. There is no cookie cutter approach to therapy.  Attunement, empathy, and trust are key.</p>

      <p>Throughout years of practice I have come to realize just how many people suffer with symptoms and complications from traumatic experience, including issues of addiction. Substance abuse is a nation wide epidemic and is often associated with traumatic experience. I recognize just how powerful these events are in shaping oneâ€™s sense of safety and well being, our relationships and our very identity.  To assist in helping those who have experienced trauma in their lives I have directed much of my continuing training and education toward acquiring greater skill and understanding in treating trauma related mental and behavioral health issues.</p>

      <p>Although clinical work carries many demands and challenges it also provides the immense satisfaction of helping others develop the skills needed to move toward a safer and healthier life. Quality client care requires the highest ethical standard of practice, commitment, teamwork, and a readiness to collaborate in order to provide optimal benefit and treatment progress.  My commitment to you will be to offer the best and most effective clinical care to achieve your treatment goals.</p>
